# AdventOC22Go
I want to learn Go - static languages with strong typing are my preference and this languages routines make threading a breeze. My hope is to build my skills in this language as I see it deployed more and more in data pipelines and other infrastructure.

I need to run a linter soon and see how things are going! Then, we can try and find some problems to introduce threading into.
